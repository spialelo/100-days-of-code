### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

#**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

#---------------- 100 Days of Code - Log - Nicole Phillips --------------#

### Day 0: Work up to January 2,2017
**Concept: My personal makeup/cosmetics bag or vanity to carry around to keep track of what's in my stash**

### Day 1: January 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Built out the remaining methods for my searchAll object.
**Thoughts** Method searchByName. There is room for improvement. My idea: split the input based on whitespace and see if any of the substrings of the input have a pattern that matches any party of the string value stored in the makeup name property at the index in the loop.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Used regex to improve the search for search by name. It seems to be working so far. Will test more and may implement something similar on the other methods.
**Thoughts** Regex can be a real pain in the...

### Day 3: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Did 1.5 challenges on Hacker Rank. The first one was just a simple print to console. The second challenge involved arrays, sums, and absolute difference. Was able to solve it in jsfiddle but not execute it in Hacker Rank
My makeup/cosmetics bag side project: removed the css from the HTML file and linked to it externally. Added a clear display button & function, plus tweaked the reset button function a tiny bit.
**Thoughts** Taking a break from Hacker Rank and going back to Code Wars until I do more research into Hacker Rank's reading of input.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Codewars challenges and did research on localStorage for my side project.
**Thoughts** It was recommended to me to look into using localStorage to save my user input, so I don't have to keep re-entering it when I navigate away from the page. Doing research on the Storage object and how to implement it when working with an array of objects.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Thoughts** This will be used at work in the future, for sure. Mainly the css styles. I'm sure the designers would like to style it a little. Update: Made the fullscreen function work, after looking up the HTML5 vide player a little bit more. Insert happy face and dance.

### Day 20: January 22, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Day 13 and 14 completed. 
**Thoughts** Slide in on scroll is a nice effect. Probably would be best used on an educational site, teaching children about history. it would keep them engaged. Difference of Copy and Reference will be reviewed in the future. I'm sure somewhere down the road, I will forget what I 'copied' or 'referenced'.
