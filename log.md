##### (delete me or comment me out)

#**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

#**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

#**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

#**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

#---------------- 100 Days of Code - Log - Nicole Phillips --------------#

### Day 0: Work up to January 2,2017
**Concept: My personal makeup/cosmetics bag or vanity to carry around to keep track of what's in my stash**

### Day 1: January 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Built out the remaining methods for my searchAll object.
**Thoughts** Method searchByName. There is room for improvement. My idea: split the input based on whitespace and see if any of the substrings of the input have a pattern that matches any party of the string value stored in the makeup name property at the index in the loop.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Used regex to improve the search for search by name. It seems to be working so far. Will test more and may implement something similar on the other methods.
**Thoughts** Regex can be a real pain in the...

### Day 3: January 5, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Did 1.5 challenges on Hacker Rank. The first one was just a simple print to console. The second challenge involved arrays, sums, and absolute difference. Was able to solve it in jsfiddle but not execute it in Hacker Rank
My makeup/cosmetics bag side project: removed the css from the HTML file and linked to it externally. Added a clear display button & function, plus tweaked the reset button function a tiny bit.
**Thoughts** Taking a break from Hacker Rank and going back to Code Wars until I do more research into Hacker Rank's reading of input.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Codewars challenges and did research on localStorage for my side project.
**Thoughts** It was recommended to me to look into using localStorage to save my user input, so I don't have to keep re-entering it when I navigate away from the page. Doing research on the Storage object and how to implement it when working with an array of objects.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

### Day 7: January 9, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Codewars challenges and reading up on gulp some more.
